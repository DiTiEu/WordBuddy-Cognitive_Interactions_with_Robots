# WordBuddy-Cognitive_Interactions_with_Robots
WordBuddy is an interactive educational robot project designed to assist children and learners in improving their word recognition and spelling skills. The robot leverages vision, voice feedback, and robot motion to engage users in a playful spelling game. The system integrates a UR3/UR3e robot with computer vision for letter recognition, a TTS (Text-to-Speech) module for audio feedback, and custom-designed blocks for tactile interaction.  This repository contains the source code, hardware setup, and all necessary assets for building and testing the WordBuddy robot. The project is in progress, with the main goal being to create a user-friendly, fun, and effective tool for enhancing literacy skills.
